# BLoC Design Pattern

### Introduction

The **BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern** is a robust architectural approach for building Flutter applications. It's designed to *enhance* the *scalability* and *maintainability* of applications by **separating business logic from the presentation layer**. This README provides an overview of the BLoC pattern, why you should consider using it, and how to adapt it to suit the specific requirements of your application.

### Key Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**
  BLoC enforces a clear separation of concerns within your codebase, distinguishing three primary components: the User Interface (UI), the BLoC (housing business logic), and the 
  Data Layer (managing data retrieval and storage).
